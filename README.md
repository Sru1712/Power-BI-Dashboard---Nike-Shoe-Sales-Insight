# Power-BI-Dashboard---Nike-Shoe-Sales-Insight
An interactive business intelligence dashboard built using Power BI to analyze Nike shoe sales performance across regions, products, sales channels, and customer reviews, enabling data-driven decision-making.


# Purpose:
The Nike Shoe Sales Insights Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales, profit, operating margin, and customer preferences.
It helps identify top-performing regions, best-selling products, profitable categories, and customer satisfaction trends, supporting strategic business decisions in sales, marketing, and inventory planning.


# Tech Satck:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization and dashboarding tool

📂 Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to calculate KPIs such as revenue, profit, operating margin, and unit sales

🧩 Data Modeling – Relationships established across sales, product, region, and review data


# Data Overview:
The project uses four interconnected tables to analyze Nike shoe sales performance, product details, time trends, and customer feedback.

- Calendar: Contains dates from 01/01/2020 to 31/12/2021 and supports time-based analysis.
- Nike Product Name: Stores product details such as Product ID, name, description, and category.
- Nike Sales Data: Core transactional table with invoice date, region, state, city, sales method, units sold, operating profit, and operating margin.
- Nike Reviews: Includes product ratings (0–5) and review counts to analyze customer satisfaction.


# Business Problem:
Retail brands like Nike generate large volumes of sales data, but without clear visualization it is difficult to answer questions such as:

- Which regions and states generate the highest revenue and profit?
- Which products and categories perform best?
- How do sales channels impact revenue?
- Are customer ratings aligned with sales performance?<br>

Raw reports alone do not provide these insights efficiently.

- Tracks overall sales performance using key KPIs
- Identifies high-performing regions and products
